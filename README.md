# TMDB Api Web Application

Welcome to the Movie Database Web Application! This is a personal project that provides detailed information about movies, TV shows, and casts related to them. 
It's built with PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Laravel, and Livewire. I built it to record my process of learning, and to see my progress through the stages.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: The application fetches data from the TMDB API, processes it, and stores it for future use.
- **User Interface**: The frontend lists movies, TV shows, and casts for users to browse.
- **User Interaction**: Users can register, comment on items, report bugs, and contact the admin.

## Usage and Development

This project is open for use and further development. **Feel free to clone the repository, explore the code, and make it your own!**

## Contributing
